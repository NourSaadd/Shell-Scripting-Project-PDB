# Shell-Scripting-Project-PDB
This project automates the retrieval and analysis of protein structure files from the RCSB Protein Data Bank using Linux shell scripting. It includes downloading .pdb files, removing invalid entries, and analyzing amino acid content based on alpha carbon atoms, with logic to handle multi-model structures.
